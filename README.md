### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

**Definition:** A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

**Laravel Implementation:**

In Laravel, adhering to the SRP involves ensuring that classes, controllers, and other components each handle a specific piece of functionality. This makes the codebase easier to maintain, test, and extend.

**Example:**

**Bad Practice:**

```php
// app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;
use App\Mail\WelcomeEmail;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        // Validate user input
        $validated = $request->validate([
            'email' => 'required|email',
            'name' => 'required',
        ]);

        // Create user
        $user = User::create($validated);

        // Send welcome email
        Mail::to($user->email)->send(new WelcomeEmail($user));

        // Log user creation
        \Log::info('User created: ' . $user->id);

        return redirect()->route('users.show', $user);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `UserController` is handling multiple responsibilities:

- Validating input
- Creating a user
- Sending an email
- Logging

**Good Practice:**

Refactor the code to adhere to SRP by delegating responsibilities to separate classes or methods.

```php
// app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Http\Requests\StoreUserRequest;
use App\Services\UserService;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    protected $userService;

    public function __construct(UserService $userService)
    {
        $this->userService = $userService;
    }

    public function store(StoreUserRequest $request)
    {
        $user = $this->userService->createUser($request->validated());

        return redirect()->route('users.show', $user);
    }
}
```

**Supporting Classes:**

- **Form Request for Validation:**

  ```php
  // app/Http/Requests/StoreUserRequest.php

  namespace App\Http\Requests;

  use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\FormRequest;

  class StoreUserRequest extends FormRequest
  {
      public function rules()
      {
          return [
              'email' => 'required|email',
              'name' => 'required',
          ];
      }
  }
  ```

- **User Service for Business Logic:**

  ```php
  // app/Services/UserService.php

  namespace App\Services;

  use App\Models\User;
  use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;
  use App\Mail\WelcomeEmail;

  class UserService
  {
      public function createUser(array $data)
      {
          $user = User::create($data);

          $this->sendWelcomeEmail($user);
          $this->logCreation($user);

          return $user;
      }

      protected function sendWelcomeEmail(User $user)
      {
          Mail::to($user->email)->send(new WelcomeEmail($user));
      }

      protected function logCreation(User $user)
      {
          \Log::info('User created: ' . $user->id);
      }
  }
  ```

**Explanation:**

- **Controller Responsibility:** Handles HTTP requests and responses.
- **Form Request Responsibility:** Validates user input.
- **User Service Responsibility:** Contains business logic related to user creation, email sending, and logging.

By separating these responsibilities, each class has a single reason to change, adhering to the SRP.

### **2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

**Definition:** Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to extend a class's behavior without modifying its source code.

**Laravel Implementation:**

In Laravel, you can use interfaces, abstract classes, and dependency injection to adhere to the OCP. This allows you to extend functionality by creating new classes rather than changing existing ones.

**Example:**

Suppose you have a payment system that needs to support multiple payment gateways.

**Bad Practice:**

```php
// app/Services/PaymentService.php

namespace App\Services;

use App\Models\Order;

class PaymentService
{
    public function processPayment(Order $order, $paymentData)
    {
        if ($paymentData['gateway'] === 'stripe') {
            // Process payment with Stripe
        } elseif ($paymentData['gateway'] === 'paypal') {
            // Process payment with PayPal
        } else {
            throw new \Exception('Unsupported payment gateway');
        }
    }
}
```

This code violates the OCP because adding a new payment gateway requires modifying the `PaymentService` class.

**Good Practice:**

Use interfaces and dependency injection to make the system open for extension.

**Payment Gateway Interface:**

```php
// app/Services/PaymentGateways/PaymentGatewayInterface.php

namespace App\Services\PaymentGateways;

use App\Models\Order;

interface PaymentGatewayInterface
{
    public function process(Order $order, array $paymentData);
}
```

**Concrete Implementations:**

```php
// app/Services/PaymentGateways/StripeGateway.php

namespace App\Services\PaymentGateways;

use App\Models\Order;

class StripeGateway implements PaymentGatewayInterface
{
    public function process(Order $order, array $paymentData)
    {
        // Process payment with Stripe
    }
}

// app/Services/PaymentGateways/PayPalGateway.php

namespace App\Services\PaymentGateways;

use App\Models\Order;

class PayPalGateway implements PaymentGatewayInterface
{
    public function process(Order $order, array $paymentData)
    {
        // Process payment with PayPal
    }
}
```

**Payment Service Using Dependency Injection:**

```php
// app/Services/PaymentService.php

namespace App\Services;

use App\Models\Order;
use App\Services\PaymentGateways\PaymentGatewayInterface;

class PaymentService
{
    protected $paymentGateway;

    public function __construct(PaymentGatewayInterface $paymentGateway)
    {
        $this->paymentGateway = $paymentGateway;
    }

    public function processPayment(Order $order, $paymentData)
    {
        $this->paymentGateway->process($order, $paymentData);
    }
}
```

**Service Provider for Binding:**

```php
// app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use App\Services\PaymentGateways\PaymentGatewayInterface;
use App\Services\PaymentGateways\StripeGateway;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register()
    {
        $this->app->bind(PaymentGatewayInterface::class, function ($app) {
            // Logic to choose which gateway to use, e.g., based on config
            return new StripeGateway();
        });
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `PaymentService` depends on the `PaymentGatewayInterface`, not a concrete implementation.
- New payment gateways can be added by creating new classes that implement the interface without modifying existing code.
- The system is **open for extension** (by adding new gateways) but **closed for modification** (existing classes don't need to change).

### **3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

**Definition:** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.

**Laravel Implementation:**

When using inheritance and polymorphism, ensure that subclasses honor the contracts defined by their parent classes or interfaces.

**Example:**

Suppose you have a base class for notifications.

**Base Class:**

```php
// app/Notifications/BaseNotification.php

namespace App\Notifications;

abstract class BaseNotification
{
    abstract public function send();
}
```

**Email Notification Subclass:**

```php
// app/Notifications/EmailNotification.php

namespace App\Notifications;

class EmailNotification extends BaseNotification
{
    public function send()
    {
        // Send email notification
    }
}
```

**SMS Notification Subclass:**

```php
// app/Notifications/SmsNotification.php

namespace App\Notifications;

class SmsNotification extends BaseNotification
{
    public function send()
    {
        // Send SMS notification
    }
}
```

**Bad Practice:**

If a subclass violates the expectations set by the base class.

```php
// app/Notifications/NullNotification.php

namespace App\Notifications;

class NullNotification extends BaseNotification
{
    public function send()
    {
        // Do nothing
    }
}
```

Using `NullNotification` may lead to unexpected behavior because it doesn't perform the action expected by the `send` method.

**Good Practice:**

Ensure that all subclasses honor the contract.

**Explanation:**

- Any instance of `BaseNotification` can be replaced with an instance of `EmailNotification` or `SmsNotification` without altering the correctness of the program.
- Subclasses should not weaken preconditions or strengthen postconditions.
- Avoid creating subclasses that do not fully implement the expected behavior.

---

### **4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

**Definition:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Interfaces should be client-specific rather than general-purpose.

**Laravel Implementation:**

Design interfaces that are specific to the client’s needs, rather than creating large, monolithic interfaces.

**Example:**

Suppose you have a general-purpose `VehicleInterface`.

**Bad Practice:**

```php
// app/Contracts/VehicleInterface.php

namespace App\Contracts;

interface VehicleInterface
{
    public function drive();
    public function fly();
    public function sail();
}
```

Clients implementing this interface are forced to implement methods they may not need.

```php
// app/Models/Car.php

namespace App\Models;

use App\Contracts\VehicleInterface;

class Car implements VehicleInterface
{
    public function drive()
    {
        // Implement driving
    }

    public function fly()
    {
        // Not applicable
    }

    public function sail()
    {
        // Not applicable
    }
}
```

**Good Practice:**

Split the interface into more specific interfaces.

```php
// app/Contracts/DrivableInterface.php

namespace App\Contracts;

interface DrivableInterface
{
    public function drive();
}

// app/Contracts/FlyableInterface.php

namespace App\Contracts;

interface FlyableInterface
{
    public function fly();
}

// app/Contracts/SailableInterface.php

namespace App\Contracts;

interface SailableInterface
{
    public function sail();
}
```

**Implementations:**

```php
// app/Models/Car.php

namespace App\Models;

use App\Contracts\DrivableInterface;

class Car implements DrivableInterface
{
    public function drive()
    {
        // Implement driving
    }
}

// app/Models/Boat.php

namespace App\Models;

use App\Contracts\SailableInterface;

class Boat implements SailableInterface
{
    public function sail()
    {
        // Implement sailing
    }
}

// app/Models/Airplane.php

namespace App\Models;

use App\Contracts\FlyableInterface;

class Airplane implements FlyableInterface
{
    public function fly()
    {
        // Implement flying
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Clients implement only the interfaces relevant to them.
- Reduces unnecessary code and dependencies.
- Makes the codebase more flexible and easier to maintain.

---

### **5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

**Definition:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

**Laravel Implementation:**

Use dependency injection and program to interfaces (contracts) rather than concrete implementations.

**Example:**

Suppose you have a logger that writes to a file.

**Bad Practice:**

```php
// app/Services/OrderService.php

namespace App\Services;

use App\Models\Order;

class OrderService
{
    protected $logger;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->logger = new \App\Services\FileLogger();
    }

    public function placeOrder(Order $order)
    {
        // Place order logic
        $this->logger->log('Order placed: ' . $order->id);
    }
}

// app/Services/FileLogger.php

namespace App\Services;

class FileLogger
{
    public function log($message)
    {
        // Write log to file
    }
}
```

**Issues:**

- `OrderService` depends on the concrete `FileLogger` class.
- Difficult to switch to a different logging mechanism (e.g., database, external service).

**Good Practice:**

Use an abstraction (interface) for the logger.

**Logger Interface:**

```php
// app/Contracts/LoggerInterface.php

namespace App\Contracts;

interface LoggerInterface
{
    public function log($message);
}
```

**Concrete Logger Implementations:**

```php
// app/Services/FileLogger.php

namespace App\Services;

use App\Contracts\LoggerInterface;

class FileLogger implements LoggerInterface
{
    public function log($message)
    {
        // Write log to file
    }
}

// app/Services/DatabaseLogger.php

namespace App\Services;

use App\Contracts\LoggerInterface;

class DatabaseLogger implements LoggerInterface
{
    public function log($message)
    {
        // Write log to database
    }
}
```

**Modified `OrderService`:**

```php
// app/Services/OrderService.php

namespace App\Services;

use App\Models\Order;
use App\Contracts\LoggerInterface;

class OrderService
{
    protected $logger;

    public function __construct(LoggerInterface $logger)
    {
        $this->logger = $logger;
    }

    public function placeOrder(Order $order)
    {
        // Place order logic
        $this->logger->log('Order placed: ' . $order->id);
    }
}
```

**Binding in Service Provider:**

```php
// app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use App\Contracts\LoggerInterface;
use App\Services\FileLogger;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register()
    {
        $this->app->bind(LoggerInterface::class, FileLogger::class);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `OrderService` depends on the abstraction `LoggerInterface`.
- High-level module (`OrderService`) and low-level module (`FileLogger` or `DatabaseLogger`) both depend on the abstraction.
- Easily switch between different logger implementations without changing `OrderService`.
- Improves testability by allowing mock implementations during testing.

---
